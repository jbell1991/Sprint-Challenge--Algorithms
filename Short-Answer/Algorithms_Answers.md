#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The runtime will increase linearly as the input increases.  


b) O(n log n) The for loop runs n times and the while loop runs log n because it splits the data.  


c) O(n) The function is being called recursively n times as it moves towards the base case.    

## Exercise II

def binary_search(building, floor_f):
    # bottom_floor = 0
    # top_floor = len(building) - 1
    # while bottom_floor <= top_floor
        # determine the middle floor
        # if the egg breaks at floor_f
            # check the floor between the bottom floor and middle floor
        # if the egg doesn't break at floor_f
            # check the floor between the middle floor and the top floor
